                    <p>Hi, my name is Michael Jean-Jacques and I am an aspiring web developer. I am currently In a 6-month coding bootcamp that will help train me to become a full stack developer.  I will be showcasing all the projects I create here. Use the links in the header above to see my work or to reach out.</p>
                    <p>I have always loved learning new concepts and ideas. Taking language courses was always something that I remembered enjoying. Which means I was naturally fascinated about learning to code. I view all the road blocks as puzzles that need to be solved. </p>
                    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
